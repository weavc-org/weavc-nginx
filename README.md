### weavc-nginx

A helpful wrapper around the nginx docker container. Helps with creating reverse proxies to other containers and enforcing SSL connections. It is based off of [`linuxserver/dockerswag`](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag), but aims to provide a lighterweight alternative that can be used more effectively as a docker service.
